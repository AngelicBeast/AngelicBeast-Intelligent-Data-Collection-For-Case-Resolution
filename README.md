This Project 4 directories:

1. Dataset: Contains Text Documentation of 7 Indian Government Acts.

2. Extracted Data:

a) act_no.csv : Contains a mapping from acts to their act number (May be updated as new acts are added).
b) data.csv : Contains all the embeddings generated for the acts, with the last column containing the act number.

3. src:

a) data extraction.py : Extracts Data from acts and converts each sentence into an embedding.
b) train_test_split.py : Splits the data into 80:20 train-test ratio and makes text files corresponding to each act.
c) api_call.py :  Sends the train and test data to ChatGpt, along with a prompt asking it to generate queries from the data.
d) embed_gen.py : Generates Embeddings from the queries generated by ChatGpt.
e) model.py : Trains Logistic regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests Classifiers with the train data.
f) testing.py : Tests the classifiers on the testing data.
g) model_parameters : Stores the model parameters in .joblib files.
