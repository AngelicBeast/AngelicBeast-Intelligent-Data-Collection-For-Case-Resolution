(4) The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (5 of 1898), shall, so far as may be, apply

labour employed in the establishment are entitled to benefits in respect of any matter which are more

continue to be entitled to the more favourable benefits in respect of that matter, notwithstanding that they
receive benefits in respect of other matters under this Act.
(2) Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed as precluding any such contract labour from

them rights or privileges in respect of any matter which are more favourable to them than those to which
they would be entitled under this Act.
31. Power to exempt in special cases.—The appropriate Government may, in the case of an
